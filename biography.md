# Grace Hopper Biography
(1906 - 1992)

## Education

She graduated from Vassar College in 1928, obtaining a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics.
She then went on to earn a master's degree in mathematics from Yale University in 1934.

She was the 11th woman to get a math PhD from Yale University.

## Entering the Navy

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, she joined the United States Navy Reserve.
She attended the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College, and graduated first in her class in 1944 becoming a lieutenant.

## Programming Career

### War Effort
Rather than be sent to work on cryptography, she was assigned to work on Harvard University's Mark I computer which
was being used by the Navy.

She specialized in converting real-world problems into mathematical equations and then into commands for the machine.
Eventually, she wrote the first computer programming manual for the Mark I.

She took an interest in the idea of subroutines, which allowed a program to call another program within it. 
Additionally, she developed the idea of a compiler, which would convert source code into machine code. 

Harvard's Mark I became the easiest computer to program because of her work and rejection of doing things the way they had always been done.

They used the computer to calculate the trajectories of rockets and artillery shells, and to solve other complex mathematical problems
required by the war effort.

### UNIVAC
After the war, she continued to work on computers, and in 1952 she and her team created the first compiler called A-0.
Next, her team developed the first programming language that used English-like, called Flow-Matic.
This ease of use made it possible for those who didn't specialize in mathematics to write programs.

In 1959, she was part of the team that developed COBOL, which was the first standardized programming language
to be used by businesses. She continued to work on developing improved compiler for COBOL over the years.
In 1970, COBOL was the most widely used programming language in the world.

### Retirement

She left the Navy in 1966, but was recalled to active duty in 1967. Eventually, she retired from the Navy in 1986 as 
a rear admiral. She was the oldest serving officer in the Navy at the time of her retirement.

### Awards

- She was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities around the world.
- She was awarded the National Medal of Technology in 1991.
- The Navy named a guided missile destroyer after her, the *U.S.S. Hopper*.
- She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 2016.

### Impact

Grace Hopper was a pioneer in computer programming, and her work laid the foundation for modern programming languages.
Through her work with COBOL and the development of the first compiler, she made it possible for people who weren't
specialists in mathematics to write programs. She supported the democratization of programming. She was known to be a mentor to many of the young people she
worked with in the field, having a lasting impact on the next generation of computer scientists.
